## Pine Script indicators and strategies

These are some indicators and strategies that can help identify more optimal times to buy or sell an asset.

These are all experimental and might not be profitable strategies.

The scripts are just for learning purposes. Nothing here is financial advice. Use scripts at your own risk!

## Learning

If you want to learn about technical analysis, here are some resources:

* https://chartchampions.com/
* https://jaysoncaspertrading.com/

Both of the above also have YouTube channels with some free content>

Other YouTube channels that provide good content include:

* [Benjamin Cowen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRvqjQPSeaWn-uEx-w0XOIg)
* [Eric Krown Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnwxzpFzZNtLH8NgTeAROFA)

For any strategy, it is important to consider volume (what big traders and entities are doing), and it also helps to add order flow analysis and data to any strategy. (e.g. from https://exocharts.com/)  Learning about Elliot Wave Theory can also be helpful.

Also, risk management is super essential and best to avoid using leverage, especially as a beginner and later only use sparingly, if at all.

The most important part of trading is psychology and managing emotions. Having a strategy (or strategies) and some scripts and automation can be helpful to remove emotions.

Here are some videos about trading psychology:
